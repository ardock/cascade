{"name":"Cascade","tagline":"Android library for lambda-friendly concurrent reactive programming","body":"# cascade\r\nReactive Cascade is an Android library for lambda-friendly reactive programming. All operations are concurrent unless there is an explicit dependency in the function or reactive chain.\r\n\r\nDocumentation is scarece as this is still an early phase project. See /docs for some presentations and JavaDoc. More will follow.\r\n\r\nThe CI server is https://travis-ci.org/paulirotta/cascade  Note that due to the nature of the library, most tests are \"system tests\" run in a custom Android App rather than traditional unit tests. We will migrate toward using Travis CI better over time.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}

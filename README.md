# cascade
Reactive Cascade is an Android library for lambda-friendly concurrent reactive programming.

The point: clean composable function chains between atomic variables, easy debug, fine grained concurrent by default -> keep all cores lit -> more responsive features and apps

Documentation is scarce as this is still an early phase project. See /docs for some presentations and JavaDoc. More will follow.

The CI server is https://travis-ci.org/futurice/cascade  Note that due to the nature of the library, most tests are "system tests" run in a custom Android App rather than traditional unit tests. We will migrate toward using Travis CI better over time.
